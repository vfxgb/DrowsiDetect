# DrowsiDetect

## Created an ML model to detect drowsiness in users based on facial features such as eye openness and mouth openness. Can currently detect when the eyes is open or closed and also if the user is yawning or not. Set to develop a web application to deploy my model and include other features such as blink rate and eyeredness which can be features of fatigue.
